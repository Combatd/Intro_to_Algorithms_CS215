# Intro_to_Algorithms_CS215
An introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms for analysis of social networks and discovering how individuals are connected.

## Topics Covered
* Algorithm Analysis
* Chain, ring, grid networks, Big Theta, and more discrete mathematics.
* Basic Graph Algorithms, Clustering coefficient and more.
* Heaps, Degree Centrality, Top K Via Partitioning and more.
* Polynode Trees with connection strengths, edge weights.
* "Harder" Node Network Problems, Tetrisian and Exponential Running Time.
* Degrees of hardness and more.

### Measuring Time
* Simplifying Assumptions
    * Simple statement takes unit time
        ```x = x + 1```
    * Sequence of simple statements is the sum
    ```if y = 4 : z = z/2```
    * Loop takes time equal to the body x iterations
    ```
    for i in range(4):
        print i
    ```
